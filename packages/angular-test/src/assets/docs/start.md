<p>
    This is a Typescript library offering you desktop UI widgets in Angular 7+. It's mostly targeted at Electron user or web applications that want to behave and look 
    like native desktop applications. 
</p>

<p>
The goal is to provide a high-performance UI kit that behaves and looks exactly like the UI of desktop operating systems. 
Thus with less hover states, no text selection, and only with animations/colors that users are already familiar with.
</p>

</ul>
