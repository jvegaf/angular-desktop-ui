<p>
    This is a library offering you desktop UI widgets in Angular 7+. It's mostly targeted at Electron user or hybrid applications. 
</p>

<p>
    It supports vibrancy, dark-mode, and tries to cover for the start MacOS. Windows and GTK will follow.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to provide a UI kit that behaves and looks exactly like the UI of desktop operating systems. 
Thus with less hover states, no text selection, and only with animations/colors that users are already familiar with.
